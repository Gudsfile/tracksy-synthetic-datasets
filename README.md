# Tracksy synthetic datasets generator

> ⚠️ Archived repository, the project is always maintained in the global [Tracksy repository](https://github.com/Gudsfile/tracksy).

Generate test data sets to test the Tracksy application during development.

Already generated datasets are available on Hugging Face : [synthetic-datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tracksy-app/synthetic-datasets).
But you can generate your own with this project and find them in the `datasets` folder.
